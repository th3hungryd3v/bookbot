# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

> Books are not included with the project, so if you plan to use this:

- create a 'books'directory (/bookbot/<create directory here>)
- add '.txt' files within (/bookbot/books/<add .txt files here>)
- run `python3 main.py <path/to/.txt>
